</p>

A lightweight standalone (performance-first*) port of Quivi, built with Tauri and Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. View static images and animated formats like WebP, APNG, AVIF, and GIF, including direct support for archive files (ZIP/CBZ, RAR/CBR, etc.).

## Quivi

Quivi is an image viewer specialized for comic and manga reading, with fast file browsing and compressed archive support.

- Original project: [Quivi](http://quivi.sourceforge.net/)
- Later continuation/fork: [qazmlpok/quivi](https://github.com/qazmlpok/quivi) (used as reference)

## Features

- **Formats**: Open images (`jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `webp`, `apng`, `avif`, `svg`, `bmp`, `ico`) and archives (`zip`, `cbz`, `rar`, `cbr`, `7z`, `cb7`, `cbt`, `tar`).
- **Archives**: Read compressed files directly as folders, including password-protected archives and archive metadata.
- **Navigation**: Browse images, folders, archives, and drives with keyboard or mouse, including parent-folder and session-only Back/Forward history.
- **Viewer Controls**: Zoom, pan, rotate, flip, change fit modes, pan with the scroll wheel, and zoom with `Mod`+wheel. Cursor auto-hides after inactivity over the viewport.
- **Manga Spread Mode**: Two-page reading mode for landscape scans with RTL/LTR reading order and half-width fit.
- **Scaling**: Choose from Pixelated, Bilinear, and Lanczos scaling.
- **Filters**: WebGL filters for Anime4K (Mode A Fast/HQ), CRT (scanlines, barrel distortion, chromatic aberration), Phosphor (dot-matrix), or Scanlines.
- **Shortcuts**: Customize keyboard combos, mouse buttons, double-click gestures, and scroll-wheel actions.
- **Persistent State**: Persists favorites, single-instance handoff, optional auto-open behavior, and the last opened image.
- **Windows Integration**: Drag and drop supported files to open them. Register file associations per-user for Windows Default Apps. Native window dragging supports PowerToys FancyZones snapping.
- **Configuration**: Choose roaming user config or portable config stored next to the executable.
- **Custom Theming**: Inject and live-reload custom CSS rules, with native light/dark mode support.
- **ICO Spritesheets**: Render multi-frame `.ico` files as generated spritesheets.
- **File Panel**: Switchable list and thumbnail view modes with virtualized card grid layout.
- **Performance**: Fast O(1) virtualized rendering handles folders and archives with thousands of items instantly. Caching native shell icons and thumbnails eliminates UI pop-in.

## Shortcuts & Controls

The shortcut engine supports simultaneous multi-key combinations (e.g. `A + B`), native mouse inputs (`MouseMiddle`, `MouseForward`), double-click gestures (`DoubleClick`), and scroll-wheel capture with modifiers (`Ctrl+ScrollUp`). All keybinds can be configured dynamically in the Options menu with built-in conflict highlighting.

> Table lists only mapped defaults. You can assign keybinds to unmapped actions in **Options**.

## Custom CSS

QuiviT supports injecting custom CSS rules to fully theme the application via **Options → Customization → Custom CSS**. Changes can be previewed by clicking `Apply` or pressing `Ctrl+S` while editing.

**Example:**
```css
html {
  font-size: 20px;
}
:root {
  --bg:           #f4ecdc;
  --surface:      #faf5e9;
  --text:         #4a3826;
  --accent:       #7a5c3e;
  --accent-hover: #634a32;
  --selected-bg:  #e6d9bd;
  --hover-bg:     #eee2c9;
}
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root:not([data-theme="light"]) {
    --bg:           #241e17;
    --surface:      #2e261c;
    --text:         #e8dcc4;
    --accent:       #c9a870;
    --accent-hover: #d9bc88;
    --selected-bg:  #3d3322;
    --hover-bg:     #332b1f;
  }
}
:root[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg:           #241e17;
  --surface:      #2e261c;
  --text:         #e8dcc4;
  --accent:       #c9a870;
  --accent-hover: #d9bc88;
  --selected-bg:  #3d3322;
  --hover-bg:     #332b1f;
}

**Developer Tools:** Inspect Element is intentionally left enabled to help users create and debug custom CSS.

**Example themes:** Try the included `matcha-latte.css` and `sage-mint.css` example themes: import them from **Options → Customization** to restyle the app.

> If a broken CSS rule makes the user interface unusable, press `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+C` in any QuiviT window. This emergency reset instantly removes the custom CSS and reloads the interface safely.

## Documentation

### System Defaults

The following system defaults are used:

- **Fit Mode:** `height-if-larger`. All fit modes align tall pages to the top rather than the center while keeping smaller images centered, depending on the mode/image size. This makes page-to-page navigation more intuitive.
- **Scaling Mode:** `bilinear`
- **Spread View:** Defaults to `off`. When enabled, reading direction defaults to `rtl`.
- **Filters:** Defaults to none active, only one filter can be active at a time. SVGs are rasterized at a capped resolution (2048px static, 512px animated); Anime4K and Lanczos fall back to Bilinear for SVGs.
- **Filter: Anime4K** Defaults to `fast` (upstream Mode A Fast). Configurable in **Options → General → Filters**.
- **Idle Cursor Auto-Hide:** Defaults to 2 seconds of inactivity over the viewport before hiding the pointer (0 to disable). Configurable in **Options → General → Viewport**.
- **Scroll-wheel Modifier:** Defaults to `hold` (hold `Ctrl` while scrolling to zoom). Can be switched to `toggle` (sticky `Ctrl`). A status-bar badge shows whether scroll zoom is latched or which bound modifier keys are currently held.
- **Pan Steps:** Keyboard panning defaults to 72px per step, and wheel panning defaults to 120px per step. Both are configurable in **Options → General → Panning**.
- **Window Title:** The OS title bar shows the current image: `filename.ext (current/total) ◦ container ◦ QuiviT` for archive pages and `filename.ext (current/total) ◦ QuiviT` for folder pages. Page count is image-only and natural-ascending, independent of the active sort.
- **Secondary Windows:** Options and Archive Info windows size to their content and open centered over the main window.
- **Shell Background:** The native window background mirrors the page's `--surface` color, so overriding it in custom CSS also updates the shell behind the webview.
- **History Trail:** Menu bar **Folder → Back / Forward** (`Alt`+arrow / `Alt+A/W` / `Alt+D/S`, plus `MouseBack` / `MouseForward`) tracks container-level navigation only: opening folders, archives, and drives. Selecting images or pages *within* a container and refreshing never create entries. The trail is session-only and capped at 100 entries.
- **Missing Path Recovery:** When the last-opened path no longer exists at startup, or the active folder/archive is deleted or moved while browsing, QuiviT falls back to the nearest existing ancestor, or the Drives view at the root.
- **Single Instance:** Enabled by default. External file opens are handed off to the active session. Toggling this setting on or off requires an app restart to take effect.
- **Default Sort:** `name` ascending. Per-directory preferences are cached for up to 100 directories, with the oldest dropped first. The global default is configurable in `quivit_config.json` under `frontend_data` as `default_sort` (`col`: `name`, `ext`, or `date`; `desc`: `false` = ascending, `true` = descending). Directories without a saved preference in `quivit_directory_sort.json` fall back to it.
- **Thumbnail Loading:** In thumbnail view, shell thumbnails (JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF) load concurrently from the OS cache at 96x96. Archive images and non-shell file thumbnails (WebP, AVIF, SVG, fallback images) have no pre-scaled cache and decode full-size 1:1 images, so they load one at a time in scroll direction order with only visible rows plus one buffer row active. This carries a higher per-image performance cost than shell thumbnails, especially for large or animated images.
- **Image Swap Buffer:** The DOM viewer keeps a decoded previous image visible while the next target image loads, then waits for a short 45ms settled-navigation window before committing the swap. This is an intentional WebView2/HTML `<img>` tradeoff: it slightly delays final activation during rapid navigation, but prevents visible blank-frame flicker that can occur when very large images are decoded, uploaded, or repainted by the browser.

### Configuration & Persistence

QuiviT manages data across three distinct tiers depending on lifecycle and scope:

**Roaming files (source of truth)**: stored in Tauri's app config directory:
`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\com.x4163.quivit`

Data is split across five files:
- `quivit_config.json`: User preferences (theme, keybinds, fit/scaling, scroll-wheel modifier, default sort, hide_cursor_delay_sec, file_list_view_mode, spread_enabled, spread_direction, spread_mode, options)
- `quivit_state.json`: Runtime state (`last_opened_path`, `last_active_image`, `scroll_zoom_latched`)
- `quivit_directory_sort.json`: Per-directory sort column/direction
- `quivit_favorites.json`: Favorited folders/files and collapsed state
- `custom_css.css`: Custom CSS source text

**WebView2 localStorage**: never the source of truth; used only as a fast cache layer:
- `quivit-theme` / `quivit-custom-css`: Pre-paint mirrors so the theme and custom CSS apply before first render (prevents flicker)
- `options-active-tab`: Session-only; cleared on each app start

**In-memory state**: session-only; reset on app exit:
- `navigationHistory`: Container-level Back/Forward history trail (capped at 100 entries)
- `ArchiveCache`: Two-archive sliding buffer retaining the active archive and the immediately preceding archive. ZIP/CBZ entries use a byte-budgeted in-memory image cache (default 512 MB) and background prefetch queue; RAR/CBR, 7Z/CB7, and TAR/CBT archives keep temporary extraction state.
- `#viewer-img-wrapper` image bridge: Four reusable DOM images (current target, decoded previous image, and adjacent preloads); nearby pages warm through off-DOM preloaders after navigation settles behind the 45ms image swap buffer
- `thumbnailCache`: 250-item bounded cache for rendered file panel thumbnails (`filePanel.js`)
- `fsUtils.js` archive caches: unlocked password cache (50 items) and encryption status cache (100 items)
- `previewTheme` / `previewCss`: Options window live theme and custom CSS previews (persisting across config reloads until Apply or Close)

**Portable Mode** can be enabled via **Options → Save config data locally**. QuiviT uses one config shape at a time: roaming mode uses the four split files above, while portable mode folds those values into a single self-contained `quivit_config.json` next to the executable. Switching modes migrates the active values into the destination shape so stale files are not treated as competing sources of truth. In portable mode, the top-level `hidden` flag controls the Windows hidden attribute on that local `quivit_config.json`: `true` hides it, and `false` leaves it visible. The attribute is synced on every app launch and on each config save; edits made to the JSON while QuiviT is running are overwritten by the in-memory state on the next save.

### Architecture

The frontend is split into a state machine, pure services, and single-owner UI modules that talk through `Core.onStateChange` instead of writing each other's DOM:

- `core.js`: App state and configuration. No DOM.
- `services/`: Pure domain: `actions.js` (`ACTION_REGISTRY` / `dispatch`), `cache.js` (`BoundedMap`, `BoundedSet`), `metadataFiles.js`, key combos, keybind rules, sorting, viewer math. Filter logic lives in `filters/`, scaling in `scaling/`, and the WebGL runtime/catalog in `pipelines/`.
- `shared/`: Cross-window theme/CSS apply, pre-paint injector, config preview / emergency reset, window fit.
- `viewer/`: Facade plus render pool, overlay canvas owner (`viewerPipelines.js`), and pan gestures. Zoom/pan/fit math lives in `services/viewerMath.js`.
- `filepanel/`: File list (virtualized) with list and thumbnail view modes. Columns, breadcrumb, resize. Favorites persistence is `favoritesStore.js`.
- `menubar/`: Chrome visibility and the sole `#statusbar` writer with dual spread indicator routing. `menubar.js` owns dropdown interaction.
- `main/`: Thin bootstrap (`main.js`) plus fullscreen, dropzone, lifecycle, metadata badge, password overlay.
- `options/`: Options window, keybind capture UI, file-association UI.
- `fsUtils.js`: Filesystem and archive navigation (no DOM).
- `shortcuts.js` / `keybinds.js`: Input dispatch and config merge. Action ids come from `ACTION_REGISTRY`.

CSS follows the same split: `global.css` holds tokens and shared rules; `main.css`, `options.css`, and `metadata.css` are page-only.

The Rust backend is split into domain-specific modules:

- `lib.rs` & `main.rs`: Bootstrap, config watcher, and main-window build.
- `config.rs`: `AppConfig`, persistence, portable mode, and pending promotion.
- `commands/`: Tauri command surface (directory, archives, animation, watcher, associations, shell).
- `archives/` & `formats.rs`: Archive readers, `ArchiveCache`, and format registry.
- `platform/` & `windows.rs`: OS-level integrations, native shell thumbnails (`IShellItemImageFactory`), external archiver temp origin resolution, dialogs, and window lifecycle.
- `tests/`: In-tree testing for archives, config, formats, protocol, and temp archive origin.
- `protocol.rs`: `quivit://` handler (archive entries, shell thumbnails, shell icons). `asset://` for direct file access.
- `ico.rs`: ICO spritesheets.
- `models.rs`: IPC structs and data models.
- `utils.rs`: Base64 and encoding helpers.

Testing spans three focused layers:
- `src-tauri/src/tests/`: In-tree Rust unit tests for archive engines, config parsing, protocol URLs, and temp archive extraction matching (`cargo test`).
- `mocha/`: Flat pure frontend unit tests for viewer math, state transitions, action registry, metadata parsing, sorting, and bounded cache (`npm test`).
- `e2e/`: WebdriverIO end-to-end test suite (`e2e/specs/`) verifying startup chrome, navigation, viewer transforms, archive formats, and OS integrations against the live debug binary under portable mode isolation (`npm run test:e2e`).

> **Design Principle:** New DOM belongs in the module that already owns that surface. New domain logic belongs in `core.js` or `services/`. Do not grow `main.js` back into a god file.

### File Associations (Windows)

**Options → File Types** registers image and archive formats with QuiviT. Registration is per-user (no admin rights required): it writes `HKCU\Software\Classes` ProgIDs, dumps format icons to the roaming config directory, and registers QuiviT as an app in **Windows Settings → Default Apps**. The "Open Windows Default Apps Settings" button deep-links straight to QuiviT's entry.

Checkboxes reflect whether QuiviT is the active default handler for each format, reading the `UserChoice` registry key first and falling back to the `Classes` registration.

> **Note on Windows 10/11 defaults:** A format's active default handler lives in the `UserChoice` registry key, which is hash-protected and cannot be written programmatically. A format with no existing `UserChoice` becomes QuiviT's once registered: double-click opens it directly. For formats already claimed by another program, registering only adds QuiviT as an *available* handler; Windows surfaces it automatically via the "How do you want to open this file?" picker when such a file is opened, OR the default can be changed permanently there, via "Open with", or in Windows Settings.

### Command-Line Interface

QuiviT accepts paths passed via the command line. When single-instance mode is enabled (default), secondary launches hand off their arguments to the primary instance. Toggling single-instance in Options requires a restart to take effect.

```bash
quivit.exe "C:\Path\To\Archive.cbz"
```

## Development & Installation

**Prerequisites:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for `npm`)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (Cargo)

Install dependencies and run the Tauri development build:
```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Run backend and frontend tests and syntax checks:
```bash
npm test                                         # Run fast Mocha frontend unit tests (< 100ms)
npm run test:e2e                                 # Run WebdriverIO E2E test suite
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml  # Run Rust backend unit tests
cd src-tauri && cargo check                      # Validate backend compilation
node --check src/js/main/main.js                 # Syntax check JS files
# etc.
```

### Action recorder and replay diagnostics

Record a scenario:
```bash
SCENARIO=flicker-bmp npm run test:record
```
Interact with the window to reproduce the flickering issue, then press `Escape` or click `Finish Recording`. The trace is saved to `e2e/scenarios/flicker-bmp.json`.

Replay and diagnose:
```bash
SCENARIO=flicker-bmp npm run test:replay
```
The runner replays the exact commands step by step, evaluating viewport invariants and printing any flickering/blank frames or unmounting races.
